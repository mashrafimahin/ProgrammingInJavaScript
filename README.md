This repository is a collection of JavaScript problem solving challenges and their solutions, each implemented in its own file. It’s great for anyone looking to practice core JavaScript concepts, sharpen their logic-building skills or explore creative ways to tackle common coding problems.

Features
Straightforward file structure: 
Each problem is represented by a dedicated .js file, named to describe the functionality—like checkPalindrome.js, twoSum.js, countVowels.js, and more.

Core JavaScript focus: 
No frameworks—just pure JS, perfect for mastering arrays, strings, loops, conditionals, and basic algorithms.

Beginner-friendly: 
Files are organized neatly, and filenames clearly indicate what each solution does making it easy to locate and understand them.

Self-contained examples: 
Jump in by opening any file and running it in Node.js or your browser’s console to see the logic in action.

Easy to extend: 
Add more problem-solution pairs as exercises grow—maintaining clarity and structure.

How to Use This Repository:
Clone or download this repository to your local machine. Open any .js file in your code editor.

Inspect the logic line by line and run it using:
• Node.js: node filename.js
• Browser console: paste the code directly and test with different inputs.

Want to test your skills? Try rewriting the solution in a different style, or optimize its performance. Add your own solved problems—just follow the naming pattern and coding style.

Why This Repository Matters

Practice made clear: 
The literal filenames and straightforward structure help you stay focused on learning, not navigating chaos.

Community contribution–ready: 
Want to share a neat trick or fix a bug? The structure makes collaboration easy for everyone.

Perfect for learners: 
If you're new to JavaScript, these bite-sized, self-contained files are ideal building blocks for learning the language one problem at a time.

Examples of What's Inside
checkPalindrome.js -- Detect if a string reads the same forwards and backwards.
twoSum.js -- Find two numbers in an array that add up to a target sum.
removeDuplicate.js -- Eliminate duplicate values from an array.
sumOfallDigit.js -- Compute the sum of all digits in a number.

Goals for Contributors:
Add new problem-and-solution pairs (e.g., findPrimeNumbers.js, fibonacciSequence.js, etc.).
Ensure each file is named clearly and includes comments or test cases for context.
Optionally, create a master index or summary file that lists all problems with a brief description.
