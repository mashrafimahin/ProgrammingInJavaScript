//! Problem: Memoize/LeetCode(2623)

//? Description:
//* Given a function fn, return a memoized version of that function.
//* A memoized function is a function that will never be called twice with the same inputs. Instead it will return a cached value.
//* You can assume there are 3 possible input functions: sum, fib, and factorial.
//* sum accepts two integers a and b and returns a + b. Assume that if a value has already been cached for the arguments (b, a) where a != b, it cannot be used for the arguments (a, b). For example, if the arguments are (3, 2) and (2, 3), two separate calls should be made.
//* fib accepts a single integer n and returns 1 if n <= 1 or fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2) otherwise.
//* factorial accepts a single integer n and returns 1 if n <= 1 or factorial(n - 1) * n otherwise.

//? Example:
//* Input:
//* fnName = "sum"
//* actions = ["call","call","getCallCount","call","getCallCount"]
//* values = [[2,2],[2,2],[],[1,2],[]]
//* Output: [4,4,1,3,2]
//* Explanation:
//* const sum = (a, b) => a + b;
//* const memoizedSum = memoize(sum);
//* memoizedSum(2, 2); // "call" - returns 4. sum() was called as (2, 2) was not seen before.
//* memoizedSum(2, 2); // "call" - returns 4. However sum() was not called because the same inputs were seen before.
//* "getCallCount" - total call count: 1
//* memoizedSum(1, 2); // "call" - returns 3. sum() was called as (1, 2) was not seen before.
//* "getCallCount" - total call count: 2

//! Solution:
/**
 * @param {Function} fn
 * @return {Function}
 */
function memoize(fn) {
  let cacheObj = new Map();

  return function (...args) {
    const key = JSON.stringify(args);

    if (cacheObj.has(key)) {
      return cacheObj.get(key);
    }

    const result = fn(...args);
    cacheObj.set(key, result);
    return result;
  };
}

//! Testcases:
let callCount = 0;
const memoizedFn = memoize(function (a, b) {
  callCount += 1;
  return a + b;
});
memoizedFn(2, 3); // 5 (from calculate)
memoizedFn(2, 3); // 5 (from cache)
